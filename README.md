# Face-Anti-Spoofing
A simple face anti-spoofing system to judge whether a face is real or fake.<br />
The system classifies the faces as real or fake based on the model that is trained with publicly available dataset.<br />
The model was built using [Resnet 50 V2 feature vector](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/resnet_v2_50/feature_vector/5).<br />

## Built With
